            <p className="lg-type">I'm a creative director and designer based in Laguna Beach CA. I currently lead global brand design at Dialpad where I'm lucky to work with talented, driven, and friendly humans. I believe in the power of design thinking, diversity, data and collaboration. My focus at Dialpad is on building a design practice at scale and I'm happiest when uncomfortable design decisions are reinforced by user data.</p>

              <p className="sm-type">Design found me. I set out to become an artist or an athelete and eventually realized that the design process was the magic that helped me connect the things I love. I have degrees in Marketing &amp; Art History. Iâ€™m a self taught front-end developer and I'm obsessed with the possibilities of design + technology. I live with my wife, two boys and Newfoundland in Laguna Beach CA. Hit me up for a coffee if your in the neighborhood.</p>

I'm a big fan of figma and designing in the browser. The font is Everett (not named after my son but partially selected for this reason) by Nolan Paparelli.</p>
